The idea of the app is to display all the events added by users in the calendar. Logged-in users can add new and remove existing events from a control panel. Users can also change own profile information and password with the control panel.

This app has the frontend built with React + Redux and runs Node.js in the backend, which stores the data into a MySQL-database.
